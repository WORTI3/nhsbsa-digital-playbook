## Github Issues

We use [Github issues][github_issues_nhsbsa_digital_playbook] to keep track of changes to the playbook. If you want to make a change, raise an issue and open it up for discussion.

When raising an issue, consider:

* __What__
  Give a brief description of the proposal.

* __Why__
  Explain why you think this should be added to the Playbook
  
  * What evidence do you have that it's needed?
  * What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of our people and the services they build?
  * Have you checked that it doesn't already exist in the Playbook?

* __Anything else__
  Include links to any examples, research or code to support your proposal, if available.

Every page in the playbook has information on how to [improve the playbook](#improve-the-playbook), with a link to create a Github issue.

## Seek peer review

Use NHSBSA Slack or Teams to draw attention to your suggestion and get feedback:

* Is there really a need?
* Is the proposal the right approach?
* Can anyone help?

## Draft content

You can write some content and submit a pull request to get it published to the playbook website.

By setting the article `status` as `DRAFT`, it will not appear in a referenced article and can only be viewed with a direct link.
Articles at `REVIEW` status will appear as a referenced article but clearly marked with it's status.
