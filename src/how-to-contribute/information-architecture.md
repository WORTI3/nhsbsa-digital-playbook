We have three levels in our Information Architecture:

* __Home__
  The home page displays a list of articles that are jumping off points into different sections.
* __Section__
  Each section will contain articles relating to that topic.
* __Additional detail__
  For more extensive and detailed content we may link from section articles into further specialist articles.
  For instance the _Developer/testing_ section article links to articles about _writing clean tests_ and _writing integration tests_.

## Sections

We have broken down our content into these initial themes:

* _Role based_
  * Delivery (including agile)
  * Content Design
  * [Research](../../research)
  * [Design](../../design)
  * Architecture
  * [Development](../../development)
  * [Testing](../../testing)
  * Platform
  * Support
* _People and ways of working_
  * Communities
  * Our people
  * Admin
  * Meetings
* _[Contributing](../)_

The Playbook is a living set of documents, and not all sections have been written.
