We have three levels in our Information Architecture:

* Home
* Section
* Additional detail

## Home

The home page displays a list of articles that are jumping off points into different sections. These include

* _Role based_
  * Delivery (including agile)
  * Content Design
  * [Research](../../research)
  * [Design](../../design)
  * Architecture
  * [Development](../../development)
  * [Test](../../test)
  * Platform
  * Support
* _People and ways of working_
  * Communities
  * Our people
  * Admin
  * Meetings
* _Contributing_

The Playbook is a living set of documents. Not all sections have been written.

## Section

Each section will contain articles relating to that topic.

## Additional detail

For more extensive and detailed content we may link from section articles into further specialist articles.

For instance the _Developer/testing_ section article links to articles about _writing clean tests_ and _writing integration tests_.
