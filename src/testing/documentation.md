## What documentation we use in test?

Within NHSBSA test we use the following documentation to support our testing, ensure quality and assure release fitness:

1. Sprint test completion reports.
2. Release test completion reports.
3. Accessibility test report.
4. Compatibility test report.
5. Performance test report.
6. Acceptance Automation reports (html reports generated from automation tests).

All of the above reports are needed prior in order for test to sign off and approve a release.

### Sprint test completion reports

These are reports that support testers work and effort per sprint. 
These reports are used to collate a sprint's test work,effort and results which are then referenced from the release test completion.

These reports include:
- Test Release focus / approach.
- Stakeholders, Resources & Approvals.
- User Stories (in and those that may have dropped out of scope since planning).
- Version Management.
- Test Metrics & results (Manual & Automated).
- Accessibility Testing (Report and Statement).
- Defect Management.
- RAID Log. (Risks, Assumptions, Issues & Dependencies).
