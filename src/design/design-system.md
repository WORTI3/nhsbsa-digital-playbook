As an NHS organisation, we follow the NHS Design System and Design Principals - these can be found here: [NHS Design System][nhs_designsys]

## Prototyping

Prototypes should be used to test user journeys - they aren't code/pixel perfect and can be iterated quickly, or thrown away. A guide to setting up the NHS Prototype Kit can be found here: [Prototyping][nhs_designsys_prototype]

Prototype code is __not__ intended to be used as production code. Designers make prototypes. Developers make applications.

## Production code

When prototypes have been user tested, journeys are ready to be developed ready for production. A guide to setting up the NHS Frontend Toolkit can be found here: [Frontend Toolkit][nhs_designsys_prod]

Styles, including colour pallete can be found here: [Styles][nhs_designsys_styles]

When designing forms, there are a numbers of components and patterns that already exist, have been heavily user tested, and are fully accessible. These can be found here: [Components][nhs_designsys_components] and [Patterns][nhs_designsys_patterns]
