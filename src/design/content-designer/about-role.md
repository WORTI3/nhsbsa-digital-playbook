### What is content design?

Content design is answering a user need in the best way for the user to consume it.

It:

* allows someone to find something quickly and easily
* is not just about writing web copy
* can take a range of formats
* should be based on research

### Why do it?

Good content design:

* helps people get the information they need in a way they expect
* focuses on the user needs by creating content that is simple and easy to understand
* makes sure content is accessible and inclusive for anyone who needs it
* keeps content across multiple services consistent by following standards set out in our style guide
* gives our users the best possible experience of our services and reduces workloads for areas of the business

### When to do it

Content design should work alongside the other professions in the UCD team, throughout the whole design journey.

Throughout this process we should test and iterate content design based on research, data and evidence.

It should also be done proactively to identify any improvements that could be made.

### Benefits

So that the user: 

* is able to access information quickly
* understands the subject matter 
* isnâ€™t excluded
* gets the outcome they need 

### Example

A good example of how content design can help can be found in the Manage your service (MYS) portal.
