## What is expected from a Content Designer in Alpha

In the Alpha phase, the team aims to develop and refine early versions of the product or service. As a Content Designer, your key responsibilities might involve:

- working with user research to see what pain points exist with design and iterate content accordingly with an intention to test
- work through multiple iterations until larger numbers of users flag less issues
- trial content ideas by working with other design disciplines with an intention to test with users and document findings
- creating a consistent user experience with other NHS / GOV services
- begin to consider all routes that users take into the service
- begin auditing content, so that historical changes can be seen and rationalised - this is usually organised by prototype version
