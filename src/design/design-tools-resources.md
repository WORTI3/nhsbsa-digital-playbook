## Tools

### Slack

We use Slack to connect with other people working on digital services across government, we also use it within Digital to communicate with each other informally. 

The [NHSBSA Digital Service](https://nhsbsadigitalservices.slack.com/) workspace is open to anyone with an `@nhsbsa.nhs.uk` email address and has various channels ranging from foodies to dad jokes!

### Microsoft Teams

We are a hybrid organisation and because of that our video conferencing tool of choice is Microsoft Teams. To login, use your `@nhsbsa.nhs.uk` email address.

Microsoft Teams is also used to communicate with others from across the entire NHSBSA organisation.

### Miro

[Miro](https://miro.com/) is our 'digital whiteboarding' tool of choice which enables distributed teams to brainstorm and collaborate with each other.

To get an NHSBSA account, email [digiadmin@nhsbsa.nhs.uk](mailto:digiadmin@nhsbsa.nhs.uk)

### Atlassian (JIRA / Confluence)

We use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence]) to organize and manage our agile projects.

To get an account, you should raise a request with our [IT Service Desk](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/sites/ITUserServices).

## Resources

### Service standards

The [service standard](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard) is set of 14 criteria which help us create and run good digital services. In addition to the 14 core criteria, the NHS has 3 extra points for health and social care.

These service standards are designed to help teams: 

- address the different needs of users 
- navigate the complexities of delivering digital services across government and health and social care

Depending on [certain criteria](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard]), you will often be assessed against the service standard during the lifetime of a service. 

### Service assessments

A Service Assessment normally takes place towards the end of a project phase e.g. 

1. Discovery → Alpha 
2. Alpha → Private Beta 
3. Private Beta → Public Beta 
4. Public Beta → Live.  

Your assessment will be run by a panel of experienced specialists from the digital community across various government departments. Panels are normally made up of 4 or 5 assessors, including a lead assessor, a user researcher, a designer and a technical lead. There might also be one or 2 observers, but they will not ask questions. 

Service Assessments can often seem daunting, but it's important to stress that an assessment is a team effort and is not just your responsibility. The panel are not there to catch you out. They’re there to offer a peer review of the work you’ve done and help you understand anything that you can potentially change or improve. 

To help project teams prepare for Service Assessments, the NHSBSA has a [Service Assessment community](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a9d236843d94d4589bf2dda569cb29980%40thread.tacv2/Service%2520Assessments?groupId=901d4e4d-5a07-4d45-b5b1-adfd4c6b6d86&tenantId=cf6d0482-86b1-4f88-8c0c-3b4de4cb402c) which is built up of various disciplines e.g. Delivery Managers, User Researchers, Designers, Developers, Testers etc... 

The Service Assessment community not only helps to perform 'mock' assessments, but they can also perform ad-hoc reviews against the service standard when requested. These 'mock' assessments help project teams prepare for their real assessment by providing advice and guidance in a less formal setting. 

### Design community

The design community runs [every 2 weeks on a Thursday afternoon at 2pm](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YTZkMDVhN2EtMzg5MC00YWVlLTllOGQtMWM5ODhmOGQyNGQx%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cf6d0482-86b1-4f88-8c0c-3b4de4cb402c%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22f093e82e-244e-4529-bbe1-301b5e2691d0%22%7d) and allows each design discipline (Service Design, Interaction Design and Content Design) to come together to share best practice, discuss challenges and generally just support each other.

To run a session, people can add their topic to an available slot in the [design community calendar](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/1c256a65-83a6-4b5c-9ccf-78f8afb6f1e8/_djb2_msteams_prefix_2670613932?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A5ee283d87bbc4ad7b8616f85d7c8b734%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=901d4e4d-5a07-4d45-b5b1-adfd4c6b6d86&tenantId=cf6d0482-86b1-4f88-8c0c-3b4de4cb402c&allowXTenantAccess=false).

If no session is planned, a session will run for designers to chat informally.

### Code club

[Code club](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CoP/pages/3824451631/Code+club) was setup in 2020 with the aim of providing a safe learning space for team members to develop their coding and prototyping skills together. This space is open to any questions or advice anyone needs.

Code club runs on the first Friday afternoon of every month at 2pm, although this can change when required.

To participate in live lessons as a host or to highlight a certain topic you would like to be covered, you can add the details to the confluence page.

### Cross-Gov Slack

[Cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) is a Slack workspace for anyone working in central government, with channels on a range of topics. It’s a place to connect with other people working on digital services across government.

The cross-government Slack was created by the Government Digital Service (GDS) in 2015 as a way for GDS to collaborate with other public sector digital service teams.

There’s tons of reasons to use cross-government Slack. For example:

- networking with other people in similar roles, to share techniques and tools
- finding out about new programmes of work
- learning from other teams on how they approach accessibility
- discussing and sharing examples of applying the GOV.UK / NHS.UK Design Systems to services
- getting help and support using GOV.UK Pay and GOV.UK Notify
- keeping up with what other people are working on in the #weeknotes channel

### Design systems

Design systems allow us to make NHS / government services consistent. When something is published to a design system as a style, component or pattern it includes details of how and when it’s been tested in user research. This can help you decide whether it’s something you can use or adapt for your service.

If the journey your user takes begins from GOV.UK, you should use the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

If the journey your user takes begins from NHS.UK (or is a NHS service), you should use the [NHS.UK design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system). 

Other government departments have built additional patterns and components within [their own design systems](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list) to help meet their own user needs.

!!! warning Important
Where possible you should always use patterns and components with research behind them, before beginning to adapt or create something new.

## Prototypes

### What are prototypes?

Interaction Designers create prototypes of their services to explore, share and test different designs before committing to building anything. 

You can quickly make and test multiple prototypes and discard the ones that do not test well. 

Making prototypes is important because it: 

- improves the usability of your service 
- helps you to make sure you’re building the right service for your users 
- helps your whole team to get a shared understanding about the future of your service 
- allows your team to explore design ideas much faster and at lower risk than using your production code 

### When to use prototypes 

You must use prototypes in the 'Alpha' phase of your service to explore and test different approaches to the design of the service. 

Prototypes can also be used in the 'Beta' and 'Live' stages of your service to explore potential new features or improvements. 

### Types of prototype 

Prototypes can vary in style from a quick pen and paper sketch to a code prototype that works like a fully interactive website. 

You should use the prototype that best meets your needs at the time. Sketches are useful for exploring and discussing basic ideas with colleagues whereas code prototypes are better for user research because they’re more realistic. 

### Using code prototypes 

Prototypes built in code can look and behave like GOV / NHS sites and are the best approach if you want to test realistic interactions that a user has with your service. 

The advantages of prototypes built in code are that: 

- they look and behave almost exactly like the real thing, on mobile as well as desktop - this means users you test with are less distracted 
- you’re always aware of the constraints of designing for the web e.g. meeting accessibility standards 
- it’s easier for the whole team to have a shared understanding of any design ideas 

The code in a prototype does not need to meet the same standards as production code. For example, it does not need to be secure or to perform well with large volumes of traffic. When you do move into production, other disciplines e.g. Developers, will make sure any code used is of good enough quality and is checked against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines. 

Developers should not just copy prototype code into production - if you spot this happening, raise it with your Delivery Manager immediately. 

The point is to test ideas as quickly as possible. If an idea tests well, you may want to work with a developer to make your code a bit clearer so that it’s easier for others to work with. 

If you're new to prototyping in code, we have developed an '[Introduction to Prototyping](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CoP/pages/2081947788/Introduction+to+Prototyping])' session that can help you get started. 

This session is intended to give a base level of knowledge to all new designers or anyone interested in learning how to begin prototyping. 

### Using the GOV.UK / NHS Prototype Kits 

The GOV.UK / NHS Prototype Kits allow you to build realistic prototypes of your service that look and behave like GOV and NHS services. 

Both prototype kits come with detailed installation instructions and some example pages to get you started. 

To use it you’ll need some basic knowledge of HTML, for example what tags and attributes are and how to copy and paste code.   

Alternatively, you can work with developers on your team to create prototypes together. 

### Sharing code prototypes 

Point 12 of the GOV / NHS Service Standard advises that we should 'make new source code open'. 

To do this, we [store our source code on Github](https://github.com/nhsbsa) and we ensure our prototypes can be viewed in a browser by [publishing our prototypes to a service called Heroku](https://nhsuk-prototype-ia.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos/heroku ).

When you’ve published your prototype, you can easily share it with others. You must protect access to your prototype with a password so that members of the public do not find it and mistake it for a real service. 

You must not use the GOV.UK / NHS Prototype Kits to make live services. It’s designed for prototyping and does not have the security or performance features needed for a live service. 

To get access to the organisational GitHub and Heroku accounts, please speak to one of the Senior Interaction Designers.
