## What is expected from a User Researcher in Live

The aim of user research in the [live phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works) is to:

- assess people’s experience of using your service
- understand evolving user needs
- test new features, changes or improvements to your service

In live, you can learn more about your users’ needs by:

- reviewing web analytics and back-office data to [measure service performance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success)
- [analysing support tickets](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/23/how-user-support-ticket-analysis-shapes-what-we-do-on-government-as-a-platform/) to identify problems users have with your service
- doing surveys to collect broader feedback
- using interviews, visits and usability testing to get a deeper understanding of any problems users tell you about
- doing face-to-face and remote usability tests to find usability and accessibility issues with features you’ve added or changed
- doing A/B testing (comparing 2 versions of a web page to see which performs better) on new and changed features

From these activities you’ll typically get:

- a deeper understanding of how different kinds of users experience your service
- insight into usability and accessibility issues and how to fix them
- ideas for ways to improve your service in the future

You’ll be doing enough research when you understand how different kinds of people experience your service, and how their needs may be changing.
