## What is expected from a User Researcher in Alpha

The aim of user research in the [alpha phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) is to:

- improve the team’s understanding of your users and their needs
- test different design ideas and service prototypes with likely users
- learn how to build or improve your service so that it helps users achieve their goal

After the problem space has been explored during discovery, it is essential that research incorporates the views and experiences of those who are easily missed in typical development cycles. Research in the alpha phase therefore should look to include:

- those with limited digital access and confidence
- people with a range of visual, hearing, motor and cognitive impairments

Secondary and tertiary users (people who provide the service or who support other users for example, caseworkers, call centre agents and charity workers) should also be consulted to ensure that products solve ‘the whole problem’ for users.

Typical user research activities in alpha might include:

- using interviews and visits to deepen your understanding of relevant aspects of your users’ lives and work
- trying out design concepts with likely users to see how well they meet user needs
- testing interactive prototypes to explore the usability of different designs

When you’re recruiting participants with disabilities, it might not be possible to test:

- paper prototypes with users who are blind or partially sighted
- prototype code with people who use assistive technologies like screen readers or speech recognition software - you can do this in beta when you start working with production code

From these research activities, you’ll typically get:


- a better understanding of your users’ needs, including their support and access requirements
- feedback on how well your designs work for users
- helpful insight into usability issues related to layout, functionality and content

You’ll have done enough research when you’re confident that your design solutions will meet the needs of your users, including those with disabilities and support needs.
