## What is expected from a User Researcher in Discovery

The aim of user research in the [discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) is to find out:

- who your likely users are and what theyâ€™re trying to do
- how they do it currently (for example, what services or channels they use)
- the problems or frustrations they experience
- what users need from your service to achieve their goal

Discoveries do not involve testing hypotheses or generating solutions, instead, they are an opportunity to explore the problem space, frame the problem to be solved and gather enough evidence to provide the team with insight as to where to look next. Discoveries provide the foundations of service delivery and set the direction of early development. As such, they are a crucial stage of product development.

A discovery can take many forms, but researchers in this phase predominantly focus on broad, exploratory research.

This research can take place in several ways, but commonly includes:

- stakeholder interviews
- user group mapping
- kick-off workshops
- assumption mapping workshops.
